In this lab we learned about the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) and how to use it to configure a NAT firewall.
The commands and interface are very similar to UNIX commands in the terminal.  There are 4 different modes you may be in when entering commmands to IOS.
Each mode has a limited set of commands you may enter while in those modes and are used for configuring different parts of IOS.
These modes are User EXEC mode which is only allowed to enter a limited number of commands and cannont read or modify configurations.
Privileged EXEC mode can configure files and other things similar to a UNIX root user.  This mode requires a password.
Global Configuration mode allows global system parameters to be modified.
Interface Configuration mode allows sparameters in a specific interface to be modified.

When we set up a computer inside a NAT and ping a computer outside the NAT, we can see that the router changes the IP address of the compute inside the NAT and masks to whatever we set it as.
For instance, if you were to ping from a computer inside the NAT with the IP address 192.168.2.2 to a computer outside the NAT, the router will mask your IP address to something else like 4.8.9.24.
The computer outside the NAT then things it is being pinged from and responding to a ping from a computer at 4.8.9.24.  The router then translates the destination of the packets it receives from the computer
outside the NAT to be the IP of the computer inside the NAT.

When we set the router to assign IP addresses using a DHCP and set our computer to get a new IP address, the IP address the computer receives is 192.168.2.4
